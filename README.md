# Keycloak-to-Keycloak Federation

> A custom [User Storage SPI](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html#_user-storage-spi) implementation which enables Keycloak-to-Keycloak federation.

## Installation

Download the jar file from the latest release or action run and place it into Keycloak's providers directory.

See [the Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration-provider#_installing_and_uninstalling_a_provider) for reference.

## Supported Keycloak versions

I usually test against the Keycloak version I'm using myself.

Consider the latest major release as generally supported.
